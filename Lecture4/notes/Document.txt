Introduction to CSS Borders:

Hello, creative minds! Today, we're going to learn about something that adds a touch of style and structure to our web elements â€“ CSS borders. It's like adding a frame to your favorite picture to make it stand out.

Border Style:

Imagine you have a coloring book, and you want to outline the drawings with different patterns - that's what border styles in CSS are like. We have options like solid, dashed, dotted, and more.

Example Code:
div {
  border-style: solid; /* This sets the border style to solid */
}
This code would create a solid border around a div element.

Border Width:

Now, let's talk about the thickness of our borders. It's like choosing how thick you want your frame around the picture to be. You can use pixels or other units to specify the width.

Example Code:
p {
  border-width: 2px; /* This sets the border width to 2 pixels */
}
Here, the p element would have a border that's 2 pixels thick.

Border Color:

Just like picking the color for your frame, you can choose the color of your border. It can be any color you like!

Example Code:
h1 {
  border-color: blue; /* This sets the border color to blue */
}
The h1 element in this code would have a blue border.

Border on Individual Sides:

Sometimes, you might want to have a border on only one side, like the top or the right. CSS lets you do that too!

Example Code:
img {
  border-top: 1px solid red; /* This sets a 1-pixel solid red border on the top side of the image */
}
Here, only the top side of the img element would have a red border.

Border Radius:

Now, let's add a bit of fun to our borders. Border radius gives our borders rounded corners, making them look sleek and friendly.

Example Code:
button {
  border-radius: 10px; /* This adds a 10-pixel border radius, creating rounded corners for the button */
}
This code would make the corners of a button element rounded.
