Introduction to CSS Comments:

Hello again, everyone! Today, we're going to learn about something really cool in CSS â€“ comments. Now, just like when you leave notes in the margins of your notebooks, we can leave notes for our computer to understand in CSS. These notes are called comments.

What are CSS Comments?

Comments in CSS are like secret messages for the computer to ignore. They don't affect how your webpage looks; they're just for you and other people who might read your code to understand what's going on.

Why Use Comments?

Comments are super helpful when you want to explain why you did something or remind yourself about a specific part of your code. It's like writing a little explanation so that when you come back to your code later, you won't be scratching your head, wondering what you were thinking.

How to Write Single-line Comments:

Writing a single-line comment in CSS is easy. You just use /* to start the comment, type your message, and then end it with */. It's like putting your note in a special box that the computer won't pay attention to.
Example Code:

Let's say you have the following CSS code:
/* This is a single-line comment */
h1 {
  color: blue; /* Change the color of the heading to blue */
}

p {
  font-size: 14px; /* Set the font size of paragraphs to 14 pixels */
}
In this example, the comments help you understand that the color of the heading is being changed to blue and the font size of paragraphs is set to 14 pixels.

How to Write Multi-line Comments:

Now, what if you want to leave a longer message, like a paragraph of notes? That's where multi-line comments come in handy. You start with /*, write your notes on as many lines as you need, and close with */.

Example Code:
/* 
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can span several lines
  Great for longer explanations or notes
*/
h1 {
  text-align: center; /* Center-align the heading */
}

/* Let's make the text in paragraphs bold */
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
/* 
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can span several lines
  Great for longer explanations or notes
*/
h1 {
  text-align: center; /* Center-align the heading */
}

/* Let's make the text in paragraphs bold */
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
In this example, the multi-line comment gives you the flexibility to write more extensive notes.
